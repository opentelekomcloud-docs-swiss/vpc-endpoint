Overview
========

Welcome to *VPC Endpoint API Reference*. The VPC Endpoint (VPCEP) service provides secure and private channels to connect your VPCs to VPC endpoint services (cloud services on the current platform or your private services), providing flexible networking without having to use EIPs.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on VPCEP resources, such as creating, deleting, or modifying VPC endpoints and VPC endpoint services. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <vpcep_02_0000>`.

If you plan to access VPCEP through an API, ensure that you are familiar with VPCEP concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in *VPC Endpoint User Guide*.
