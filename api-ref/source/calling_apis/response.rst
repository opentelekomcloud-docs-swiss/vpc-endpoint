Response
========

Status Code
-----------

After sending a request, you will receive a response, including a status code, response header, and response body.

A status code is a group of digits, ranging from 1xx to 5xx. It indicates the status of a request. For more information, see :ref:`Status Codes <vpcep_08_0001>`.

For example, if status code **201** is returned for calling the API used to `obtain a user token <https://docs.sc.otc.t-systems.com/api/iam/en-us_topic_0057845583.html>`__, the request is successful.

Response Header
---------------

Similar to a request, a response also has a header, for example, **Content-Type**.

:ref:`Figure 1 <vpcep_03_0004__en-us_topic_0170155703_fig4865141011511>` shows the response header fields for the API used to `obtain a user token <https://docs.sc.otc.t-systems.com/api/iam/en-us_topic_0057845583.html>`__. The **X-Subject-Token** header field is the desired user token. This token can then be used to authenticate the calling of other APIs.

.. note::

   For security purposes, you are advised to set the token in ciphertext in configuration files or environment variables and decrypt it when using it.

(Optional) Response Body
------------------------

The body of a response is often returned in a structured format (for example, JSON or XML) as specified in the **Content-Type** header field. The response body transfers content except the response header.

The following is part of the response body for the API used to `obtain a user token <https://docs.sc.otc.t-systems.com/api/iam/en-us_topic_0057845583.html>`__.

::

   {
       "token": {
           "expires_at": "2019-02-13T06:52:13.855000Z",
           "methods": [
               "password"
           ],
           "catalog": [
               {
                   "endpoints": [
                       {
                           "region_id": "az-01",
   ......

If an error occurs during API calling, an error code and a message will be displayed. The following shows an error response body.

::

   {
       "error_msg": "The request message format is invalid.",
       "error_code": "IMG.0001"
   }

In the response body, **error_code** is an error code, and **error_msg** provides information about the error.
